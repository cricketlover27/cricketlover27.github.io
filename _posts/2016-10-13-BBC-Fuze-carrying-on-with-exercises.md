    <td>Me and my partner, as always, learnt off each other. We would take it in turns to write out the code, and we would also take it in turns to read it out to ourself and the other person. We would check if the code was correct before running the program and code. We learnt more code and tried to learn how to start using the artboard. When I was attempting to improve my Github page I would, obviously using the help my teacher would give me, and I would use a website which our teacher informed us about and is very helpful. I learnt how to use rgba,how to center the text (although my text is not in the center) and how to make the table cover the full width of the page. </td>

    <td>I was trying to sort out my Github page at the wrong time, when I should have been learning about BBC Fuze and trying to learn more code about that. I also have been unable to figure out how to align the text to the center of the page. These two things I need to work on. Me and my partner partly reached our target as we couldn't set up the artboard which is a key component in level 4 of the BBC Fuze. Me and my partner will also work on this. We will try to have both of these exercises fully completed next time. </td>

    <td>What I will change for next time will include not working on my Github page at the wrong time. Also, I will have attempted to align the text to the center of the page on Github, although I have spent quite a while working on that already. Me an my partner will try to have the artboard correctly set up next time too. However,  all in all I believe that this was a successful lesson for me. </td>
