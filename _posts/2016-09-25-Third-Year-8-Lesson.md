    <td>This lesson me and my partner worked much more quickly than last lesson which was part of our target for next lesson and was in what we could have improved. We shared the work out more evenly this lesson and we worked as well as we could do. One person in the pair would read out the book and the other would complete the exercise. We switched around a couple of times and spent half the lesson on each.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At some stage we would go off topic and talk to a pair, sometimes about BBC Fuze and sometimes not. This meant that we didn't work as quick as we could have meaning we didn’t do as much work as we could. At times when I was working I nearly forgot to save the work meaning that it would have gone which is a bad habit. This is because, although we didn’t need to save our work, it is a bad habit for the future.

  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner will not talk to other pairs, unless we need help and they could help us. I will also make sure to save my work. Although we reached our target we felt that we could have worked even quicker so we will try to do that. </td>
