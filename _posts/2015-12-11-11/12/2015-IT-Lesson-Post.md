IT Lesson 11/12/2015 

What Went Well:  

In this IT lesson, we had to change the background of this page to make it look good and interesting. I was able to execute this easily and quickly. We were able to change the background and writing- as you can probably see I changed the background to green and the writing to red.  

How I Could Have Improved: 

I could have improved by experimenting a bit more with the colours by seeing different combinations and completing the extension task, which was to find out why writing appears in a table format but the lines don't appear. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the lesson and thought I was able to execute what I was told well!
