    <td>For, half of the lesson, we were spent going through the 'success criteria' of our Github pages and what we need to do get certain grades and results. We learnt that we needed to have a well thought out and interesting blog posts, that our page was supposed to be kept looking nice and pretty. During, the BBC Fuze work, I was able to fully set up the breadboard and get it working for one of the exercises, me and my partner only did the coding for one of the two exercises we wanted to complete due to a shortened amount of time on the Fuze boxes. This meant I learnt how to set up the breadboard and some more of the coding.  </td>

    <td>As we are getting graded 1-9 on our Github pages I currently think that I will get a mark between the region of 5-7. I have struggled to centrally align the conditioner and have not been able to get the table produced the way I want it to. However, I have learned how to get the table and use tools such as rgba (red, green, blue and transparency) instead of using the regular code we used. In this lesson, I think that me and my partner needed to work better as a pair as for half of the lesson I was spending doing the work while my partner was getting help from the teacher. Although this helped us progress in different ways, my partner would have missed out on part of the coding. </td>

    <td>Me and my partner will work in a team more with the Fuze boxes. On my Github page I will try to have sorted out the alignment of the container, trying to put it in the center of the page and try to have sorted out the table, making it look more like it does on the Google Doc it had been produced on. </td>
