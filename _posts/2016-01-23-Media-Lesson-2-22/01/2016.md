About My Second Media Lesson  

WWW: 

During this lesson, we looked at more adverts (for the second lesson in a row), discussed the advert had a mini session where half of the room was the "I agree" side and the other was “I disagree”. During this lesson, we also looked at other pupil's homework, read them and gave them a grade and a target. I thought I was able to read other people’s homework well, and tell them reasons why I chose that grade well too. I feel like I respected other people’s opinions well, and had good reasons when I put my hand up. 

EBI: 

Although my answers were good when I raised my hand, I feel that I could have put my hand up more.
