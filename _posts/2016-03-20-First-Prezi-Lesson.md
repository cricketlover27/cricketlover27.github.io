First Prezi Lesson 

In today's lesson, we were starting to learn about Prezi. Our teacher showed us two different ways how to make documents and presentations on Prezi. We then started to mess about and try Prezi for about 15 minutes. I think that I easily worked out different methods of making presentations and looking at how to do different things. I feel that I could have tried out a few more things on Prezi, even though I think that I tried quite a lot.
