    <td>Only a small bit of knowledge on Codecademy. Starting to know more. </td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try to reach 20% on Python.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I read the instructions as usual. Me and my partner tried to work at a similar speed so incase we stuck we could help each other. This worked as we could help each other out when needed and made us get on to the next exercises quicker. Also, in this lesson I worked a bit on my Github page. I aimed to have a background which would suit my colour scheme. I completed 12 of the 15 exercises in stage three on the Boolean work. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I could focus on my Github page as homework next time so that I can reach my target more easily. I need to remember how to create a variable and make sure I use capital letters for Boolean Logic. I will try to reach 25% by the end of next lesson.</td>
