**Buzzfeed!?**

In this lesson, which was a carry on from the foundations of last lesson, we began to create a buzzfeed-like quiz, on the coding site repl.it. 

This was by asking multiple questions, with a guaranteed reply. For example…

What is your favourite sport? Pick a number. 

1-Golf 2-Cricket 3-Football 

If answer == 1, say "You're boring, aren’t you!"

If answer == 2, say "You're a good lad."

If answer == 3, say "The same as everyone, aren't you!?"

This would be repeated for all 5 questions. 

At the end of the quiz it would add up all of the numbers in which you picked. It would then give you a reply on what the computer thinks you are like. For example… 

If Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5 is less than 5, say "Maybe you need to take more risks". 

There would also be replies for scores between 5 and 10 and 10 or above. 

**WWW:**

I understood this coding well, and managed to complete all of the coding which was required of me, including asking multiple questions.

**EBI:**

I think I could have made my coding more complex, by having possibly 4 possible answers for each question which I asked. 

However, overall, I am happy with my progress made in this lesson.
