First lesson in year 8 BBC Fuze

As it was our first lesson back, we chose our seats, logged into the Google Classroom our teacher had set up for us and we did some work on BBC Fuze  , however we didn't get as much time as we would have liked as there was some confusion with the classes. 

WWW: I went to the correct classroom and I was in the correct class. I understood what we were doing well and I knew how to complete the exercises. Me and my partner got quite far into the first exercise and we helped out another group without doing their work for them. 

EBI: We could have possibly set up our equipment up quicker and maybe worked better as a team. 

However, overall I thought this was a very successful lesson.
