    <td>I went back through previous exercises when I was struggling to complete exercises - I did not know that this was possible before. I also thought that there was quite a lot of exercises in the unit of work that I completed, so I thought I worked efficiently. Furthermore I was a couple of minutes late to the lesson due to our form being let out of lessons late. I felt as if I understood Boolean Logic well. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel that it would help if I got to the lesson on time, however, i feel that I need to remember to read the informations as well as the instructions. Also, instead of asking for help straight away I could try multiple different ways to complete the exercise. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevere more and try to reach 27% on codecademy. </td>
