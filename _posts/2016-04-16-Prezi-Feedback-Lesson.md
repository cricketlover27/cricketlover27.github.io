Prezi Feedback Lesson 

In this lesson we talked about our presentations that were produced on Prezi over half term. 

Our teacher showed us a couple of presentations, and he picked out the mistakes, so that we could improve our presentations as part of our homework. 

WWW: During the lesson I felt that I contributed very well and I answered as many questions as I could. Also, during the lesson, we had to post three things that would make our Prezis better. During that exercise I earned a merit. I also feel that I was able to complete the homework easily. 

EBI: I could have contributed a bit more to the lesson. 

The points that our teacher made us focus on were checking through your work, no silly mistakes with grammar and spelling and don't plagiarize.
