Microbit Making Game First Lesson 

In today's lesson we were improving our Microbit planning homework and after that we started creating our Microbit games. 

WWW: There wasn't much wrong with my plan so I was able to complete that task quickly. Me and my partner then started to figure out most of the coding. 

EBI: In our game, it begins with instructions and we are not sure how to speed the words up, so it would have been nice to figure that out. We could have also created a bit more code. 

I didn't learn much this lesson because I already knew how to create the code we needed. However, I did learn what a good IT plan for a game looks like. Overall, I think it was a very successful lesson.
