**4th Lesson of Year 9 on Google Sheets **

 

This lesson was our last of this half term, and was spent clearing up all of our Google Sheets work which we have done so far. Also, I had to catch up on some of the work, which I struggled to do at home, due to being ill the week before. 

WWW: I was able to clear up all of the mistakes in which I had made, and also add to what I had already done. I also learnt how to embed my Google Sheets work into Google Docs and Github, which I did not previously know. Furthermore, I completed my work with enough time left, meaning I was able to learn how to embed my work. 

EBI: Although I was able to do most of the work, I was unable to complete the Profit and Losses page, as I found it too hard to work on and did not understand how to complete this section. I will try to have this completed over half term. 

My Google Sheets work will be on my next post.
