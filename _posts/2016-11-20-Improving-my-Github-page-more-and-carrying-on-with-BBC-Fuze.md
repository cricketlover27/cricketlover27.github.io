    <td>In this lesson I carried on working on BBC Fuze with my partner. I also finally figured out how to correct my table. Me and my partner worked well in a pair, assigning different roles for setting up the breadboard. We just about set up the breadboard by the end of the lesson. We learnt which parts we needed to put each wire in. For part of the lesson my partner was getting help for his Github page. I sorted out my Github table by seeing what I needed to correct on the css website. I felt I worked well but not as well as I would have liked to.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner should have worked more efficiently during setting up the breadboard. This week we didn't know how to set it up fully, but we do now so we will hope to complete the next exercise. I think that I needed to be quicker whilst my partner was getting his Github page helped with. I left my partner during the lesson to get help but I did not succeed. Later, for homework I realised what I did wrong.</td>

    <td>Check through my code fully and thoroughly to ensure that I have not made errors and ensure I have the correct code.</td>
