About the Third Media Lesson 

In this lesson, we looked at advantages and disadvantages of social media and ways we could stop this. We also did a mini exercise after the class conversation about the advantages and disadvantages of social media in groups of 5.

WWW: 

In my opinion the things that I thought went well, were my understanding of what the teacher was telling us and how to stop/ keep safe from the disadvantages, I listened well to both the teacher and other answers from the other pupils. Also, I feel that when I raised my hand to answer a question, I answered well. As well as that, I thought I was important in the group exercise, participated well, and had good reasons for my choice. 

EBI: 

In my opinion, this lesson would have been even better if I participated in the class discussion more. 

Overall, I had a lot of fun during the lesson and most importantly learnt a lot and thought the lesson was helpful.
