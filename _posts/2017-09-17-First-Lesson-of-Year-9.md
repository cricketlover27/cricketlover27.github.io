First Lesson of Year 9 (11/09/17)

Today was our first lesson of the year, year 9. We had the same teacher which we had or half of last year, which was helpful as we knew the routine for his lessons. In this lesson we learnt how to navigate round and use Google Sheets. I understood the majority of the work, apart from the homework, which was to use V-lookup. 

However, I was able to create the lists quickly and correctly, including the use of "Average", “”Sum” and “Product”. I was also able to participate to class discussions and work well with my partner, Will, who came into the lesson late due to a music lesson. 

Overall, I feel that this lesson was successful and I learnt a lot about Google Sheets.
