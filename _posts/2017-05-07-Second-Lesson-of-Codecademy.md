  <tr>
    <td>I read the information, as I was supposed to. If I did not get the answer correct the first time I would go back to a previous exercise to see if I could learn anything from that. If that did not work I would press the help button, and finally if that did not work I would ask the teacher a fellow classmate for help. I also learnt from others as they told me some information that I did not know previously. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes, I was tempted to ask a peer if they could do one of the stages for me, however I then realised it would not help me learn and I would get even more stuck on the exercises to come. I also spoke to people round me too much about stuff not related to my work, which could have caused me to get up to 15%. I also need to make sure my code is what I would like it to ne before submitting, with no typing errors. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Try to get less distracted and reach 20% by the end of the lesson.</td>
