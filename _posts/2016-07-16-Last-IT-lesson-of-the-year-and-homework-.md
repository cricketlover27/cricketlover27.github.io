In this lesson, we were once again talking about Internet safety, but the majority of the lesson was spent on propaganda. 

**WWW**:I felt as if I understood what the teacher was telling us. I learnt what propaganda was and I learnt what indicates propaganda.                                         

**EBI**:I could have contributed to class discussions a bit more, even though I contributed a fair amount.  

**Homework**: Our homework was to watch the BBC News and then watch the Al Jazeera News and to see the difference between how the two channels talk about the news try have.

I thought that Al Jazeera channel used much less propaganda, and didn't use as much biased language whereas as the BBC did.
