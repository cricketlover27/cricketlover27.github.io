In this lesson I wasn't actually in the lesson so I had to catch up on the work at home. I thought that I was able to work efficiently and well as I completed two more of the tutorials which were quite tough. 

WWW: I learnt how to create a game on Micro:bit and I learnt how to use some more of the coding which I thought I wouldn't be able to use. 

EBI: It would have been better if I had completed the extensions as I struggled to work them out.
