**Continuation of Google Sheets Work - 2/10/2017 **

This week, and i this lesson, we were working on using Vlookup, which I struggled to use at home, meaning I found this week though, where we were using Vlookup. However, we also looked at how to apply a discount, which I was able to do. 

In the lesson, I contributed well to class discussion, and contributed where I could. I was also independent with my learning, as I kept trying to do my work, until I had to search for help on the internet, which my teacher commended me for towards the end of the lesson. 

By next lesson, I will try to have my Vlookup completed.
