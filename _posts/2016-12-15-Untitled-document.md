In this lesson, as it was the last IT lesson of the half term we were allowed to play code related games. These two games were Lightbot and Spritebot. These were very fun and helped me improve my coding. I was one of the few people to complete all of the levels on Lightbot, but I didn't have much time on Spritebot, meaning I could have worked quicker. I was also helping out Rowan quite a lot, who sits next to me, as he was struggling with some levels.
