This lesson was a slightly different lesson as we were talking about online safety and how to keep safe from rapists and peadophiles. 

We were told to keep personal information to ourselves and friends only, and not reveal it to strangers on the internet. We were told not to interact with strangers and not to trust people that you don't know. 

We were also told not to meet strangers off the internet, especially if they request to meet you in strange places. 

All in all, I think this was a very useful lesson.
