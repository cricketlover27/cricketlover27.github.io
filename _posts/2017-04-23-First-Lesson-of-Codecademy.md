  <tr>
    <td>First of all I read about how the certain type of coding worked, as there was a small piece of information. Then, obviously I read the instructions. I also spoke to the people around me when I could not move on to the next stage, but not asking them for the answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would often make silly errors, or leave out the smallest parts of the coding but make a lot of difference. For example, when writing notes I would forget the '#' and when typing out ‘True’ and ‘False’ for the Boolean Logic i would sometimes forget the capital letter. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will check my coding before submitting it to try to reach the next stage. I will try to be up to 15% by the end of next lesson, depending on how much time we get to work on Codecademy. </td>
  </tr>
