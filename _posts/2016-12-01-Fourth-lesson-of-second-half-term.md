    <td>To complete the exercise and move on to the robot arms and I need to check through the code fully to ensure that it works.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>As my partner was not here for this lesson and there were not enough power supplies for all groups, I had to work in a group of 3. Luckily, I picked a group which worked well and were one exercise ahead of me so that I did not have to do the same exercise again and I got to learn more coding from their code and exercise. We worked well as one person would set up the breadboard, the other reading out the code and the other typing in the code. We made sure the code was correct before inputting it. Later, we got onto the robot arms section. We learnt that the coding (1) was to move it forward, (-1) backwards and (0) to stop it from moving. </td>

    <td>Sadly, when we got ono the robot arms part, I didn't get a go to actually type in the coding, although I understood what it meant. I need to work on setting up the breadboard though, still as I saw how to do parts of it but not all of it.  </td>

    <td>Know how to set up the breadboard and make sure I have a chance to use the robot arms part of the coding when I do it with my usual partner. </td>
