In today's lesson we were on Microbit for the first time and were trying different things out. We used tutorials with the option to attempt to make our own design, which enabled us to learn out quite a lot about Microbit.

WWW: I learnt about key parts of Microbit and how it worked, so now I feel that it is very simple to use. At first, when our teacher showed us about Microbit I thought it was going to be very complex. 

EBI: I could have tried to create a more complex pattern in the lesson.
