Media Lesson - First to a Million 

In this lesson we watched a mini series called First to a Million. We watched it for the majority of the lesson, and after that had a discussion. 

As, in the movie we watched, a boy called Tariq made some mistakes, and we discussed what we would have done in that situation and what we would do afterwards to make the situation seem better.

I thought I contributed to the lesson well and understood what the teacher was telling us. 

I thought that I could have made better decisions during the lesson, as in the video there was a question on what to do next. I believe I occasionally made the wrong choice and that would be how I would want to improve.
