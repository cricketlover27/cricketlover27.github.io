Microbit Planning For Game and Lucidchart: 

In today's lesson we did a survey for the majority of the lesson, then started to plan our game on microbit. The survey was about access to social media and devices. 

WWW: I learnt how to save a Lucidchart flowchart, and I learnt how to create a flowchart too. This included 'Terminator', ‘Data’, ‘Process’, ‘Decision’ and ‘Data flow’. 

EBI: I took about 5 hours to complete this homework as it took me a long time to think of the game, then write the plan and complete the flowchart. I thought we were given quite a lot of homework in this less than the normal amount we get from IT lessons.
