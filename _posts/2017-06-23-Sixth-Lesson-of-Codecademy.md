    <td>I learnt on how to create a variable in this lesson, which meant I was able to complete the work more easily than I had before as that was key to coding, especially the section that I was working on. Me and my partner only spoke about stuff which we were stuck on, and helped each other when we were stuck. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could stop helping people, and instead focus on my work and not go around the room. This slowed me down when I could have done more work. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to focus on my work as much as possible and attempt to reach 35%. </td>
