    <td>Me and my partner worked very well together in a pair. One of us would read out the text in the book and the coding, then the other would type the coding into the Fuze box. We also worked efficiently considering the round up of the first chapter was quite long. We also completed exercise 2.1 on Fuze which introduced Boolean Algebra which was something that I had touched on before in class but not known too much about. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner partly went off topic at times and started talking about subjects that were not related to what we were learning about. However, I believed we worked well, and this showed as we reached our target. Also, sometimes I make silly mistakes while typing the code so that is something to work on too. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by trying to correct my silly mistakes and not go off topic in the lessons. I will also try to set up the equipment quicker which will mean we can do even more work in the lesson. </td>
