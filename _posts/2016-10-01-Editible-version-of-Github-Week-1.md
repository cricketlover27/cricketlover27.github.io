    <td>At the start of the lesson, everyone was setting up their Uze boxes as we all thought that we were doing another BBC Fuze lesson. The strategies I used were, as always, listen to the teacher, I asked any peers for tips and used the internet to help me. I learnt how to add an image as the background and how to add a table. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sadly, on my page to the left of the screen there is a whitemargin which I am unsure about how to remove it. I am going to try to sort it out for next lesson. Also, as part of our homework we have to change the background every week so that is something I will work on too. I will also try not to get distracted by people asking me for any help, and focus on my work until that part of the task is complete.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try to remove the margin on the left hand side of the screen so that my page looks much better. I will try to not get distracted by people asking for my help, meaning I will focus on my task more than theirs. I will try to work a bit quicker so that I could have figured out how to complete the work in the lesson, instead of at home.</td>
