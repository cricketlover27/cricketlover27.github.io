    <td>I worked with my partners and used code which we knew to help us and make our work better. We then worked together to find the remaining code. I was able to block out Ollie and Zimo in this lesson, which helped me, however I was still unable to fully block them out. </td>

    <td>I will ignore Ollie and Zino, and make sure I always stay on task, as sometimes me and my partner spoke about unnecessary subjects. </td>
