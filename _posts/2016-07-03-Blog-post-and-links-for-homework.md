In this lesson, we finally got our microbits and we also talked about internet safety, especially sexting and revenge porn. We were put into groups of four to discuss social media which people can contact on. 

WWW: In each group there was a spokesman, I was the spokesman for our group. We came up with some really good ideas and learnt other social media sites too. 

EBI: We could have come up with a few more points in our group. 

For our homework we were told to read news articles about sexting and revenge porn. We were told to link the articles we read into our blog post. Below are the articles I read.
