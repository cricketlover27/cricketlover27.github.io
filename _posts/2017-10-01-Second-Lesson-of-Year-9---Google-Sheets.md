**Second Lesson of Year 9 - Google Sheets **

This lesson was our second lesson of the year, and we were working on Google Sheets. 

In this lesson, we worked out how to find out how to work out finding the grand total of an order and the grand total of the profit. We worked out how to find the VAT, delivery and how to use a discount. I found this difficult at first, but then realised it was quite simple. 

I completed the work at home, as I was unable to finish the work in the lesson. I believe that this was because I was working in a calmer environment, which I should try to find next lesson as I can get more work done.
