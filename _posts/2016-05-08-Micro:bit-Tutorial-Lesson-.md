In today's lesson we were on Micro:bit and we were completing tutorials. We learnt new ways of creating code and how to include more of the blocks and parts of the code that we hadnâ€™t used before. 

WWW: I completed three out of the six tutorials which we will continue next lesson, which was just above the average of the class. 

EBI: I could have completed one more tutorial and possibly worked more efficiently.
