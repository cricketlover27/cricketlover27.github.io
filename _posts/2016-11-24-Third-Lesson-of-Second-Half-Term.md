    <td>Me and my partner both set up the breadboard at the same time this time, instead of one doing the breadboard and one doing the coding. This helped as as we got more done and we were able to understand the code and breadboard more easily. I learnt how to set up the breadboard quicker and more easily. We only got two of the lights on the breadboard flashing though, so we were slightly frustrated at that. However, I think that this was quite a successful lesson in order  of coding and the breadboard. I didn't need want to do any work on my Github page as I am happy with how it looks and though it would be better to work on the Fuze boxes.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner though that we would be able to fully complete the exercise. I thought that I did slightly more work than my partner in this lesson as I set up the majority of the breadboard and we shared the coding out evenly. We also need to figure out how to fully have the breadboard set up.</td>

    <td>Have the breadboard fully set up and know how to have set it up.</td>
