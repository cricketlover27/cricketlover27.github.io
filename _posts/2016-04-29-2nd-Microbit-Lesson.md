In today's lesson we were on Microbit again and we were creating projects that would generate random names and numbers. We learnt how to create a Microbit that had a random name generator (we used our school houses), and we also learned how to save the code from Microbit in a very simple manner. 

WWW: I feel that I was able to create the Microbit quick and easily and I also felt that I understood what the teacher was saying very well. 

EBI: I could have contributed to class discussions more.
