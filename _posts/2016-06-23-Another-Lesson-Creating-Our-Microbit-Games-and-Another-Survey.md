**Another Lesson Creating Our Microbit Games and Another Survey **

In today's lesson, we were carrying on creating our Microbit games and we also had to complete another survey. The survey was crammed in at the end of the lesson, so we didn’t have that much time to complete it. 

WWW: Me and my partner completed more of our game and worked out how to get a "character" moving across the top for our game. Also, during the completion of the survey, I was one of the first to complete it and I felt that I was able to complete efficiently and quite easily, sometimes not knowing meanings of words. 

EBI: There were errors in me and my partner's code, which we would have liked to sort out, which we haven’t done yet. We also would have liked to complete a bit more of our code for our game.
