    <td>Me and my partner worked very well together this lesson, as we, finally, had completed exercise 4.1 on the fuze boxes. (Yay). We learnt how to properly set up the breadboard and learnt some more of the coding. We used other groups to help us - but they didn't do it for us! Also, for a tiny portion of the lesson, my partner was having to do work to his Github page so I had to work efficiently, luckily I did, The pair next to me was missing one of the pair, so for some parts of the lesson I was helping him out. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although we completed the exercise, we found it much easier this week and feel as if we would be able able to have completed more of exercise 4.2. However, next week the pair next to us will have both people in the pair working, I think anyway, so that will make us be able to focus more on our work next week.</td>

    <td>Work more efficiently in our pair. Could assign different roles to each other.</td>
