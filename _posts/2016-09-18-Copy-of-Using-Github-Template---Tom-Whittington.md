    <td>As we were working in pairs, we always tried to complete part of the task and explain the process in doing it to our partner. We always used any tips and tricks from the book to also help us. If we were both unsure we would use the book first before asking other pairs if they could give us any tips.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner struggled setting up our resources which instantly limited us and meant we were behind everyone else at the start of the lesson. We also didn't have a memory stick which meant we couldn't save our work, however, our teacher was kind and said we could start of from where we finished without needing the memory stick.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will try to work quicker, both individually and as a pair. We will use tools more effectively and try to keep on reaching our goal for the lesson. 

For the last two lessons I have been unsure on if I was supposed to use this template for my homework on the blog. Last week I didn't use this template and this week I decided to in case I was wrong in either of the weeks. This would mean I would only get in trouble for one week if I were to get in trouble. I also forgot to make a copy of this last week and I think I got the homework wrong. This means I should've listened to instructions in the lessons better.</td>
