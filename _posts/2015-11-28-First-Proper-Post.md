My First Proper Post 

What Went Well 

In my IT lesson today I thought that I understood everything the teacher was telling me and I executed it very well- resulting in always being one of the first done. I feel that if anybody needed help (which luckily they didn't) I would be able to help them. I answered a lot of questions that were required to answer well and I didn’t ask any silly questions (unlike a lot of people.) Overall, I thought the lesson went well and I really enjoyed it! 

How I Could Improve 

                        

I could have improved my work in the lesson by making the look of my page better- the only reason I didn't is because I like how it looks at the moment! I could have messed around with the webpage in the lesson however, we didn’t have any time as some people were struggling to make an account, had a short memory and didn’t see the words in the top left corner- "This was successful, YOU CAN NOW CLOSE THIS TAB!" when the teacher clearly said this would happen and you should close the tab. Also, I could have helped people that needed help. Overall I thought I did well in the lesson and really enjoyed it.
