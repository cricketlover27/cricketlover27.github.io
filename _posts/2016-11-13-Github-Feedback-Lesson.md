    <td>In the lesson, our teacher gave us some very good and in depth analysis of some of our Github pages. Firstly, we were told the grade boundaries and we were explained about them. We then looked at some Github pages and analysed them and suggested reasons on how to improve them. I learnt that to make my page better I needed to centre the container, make the writing more visible, even though it was visible enough before and make the background a bit better looking. I learnt this by listening to the teacher and thinking about how to improve my work by looking at work that my classmates had created.

    <td>I could have contributed more to class discussions as I felt that I had a lot to contribute but didn't say it out loud. This would have helped me learn if my ideas were correct as the teacher would have said if they were good ideas or not. </td>
