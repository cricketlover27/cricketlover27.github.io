    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try to reach 27% on Python.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I smashed it and reached 33%! This was partly because I was very near the end of one section and I found the next section very simple. </td>

    <td>Me and my partner worked very well with each other in this lesson. Instead of speaking to each other about subjects which we should not be talking about, we talked about the work throughout the whole lesson and managed to get a very high amount of work done. We often went through previous exercises in order to complete an exercise. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I sometimes struggle and forget how to create a variable, which is essential in coding. I will also try to get less hints off my partner, meaning I understand the process better. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Reach 35% on Python by the end of next lesson. </td>
