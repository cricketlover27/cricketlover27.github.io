In my opinion, I felt like I understood the meaning of media well, was able to answer questions when I raised my hand up, and when I was picked on to answer questions I answered well. During the lesson we watched an advert to do with hamsters going to the gym to turn from overweight to a good weight and they arrived in a KIA car at the red carpet.

The girls at the red carpet loved the hamsters and the hamsters were supposedly 'cool'.

EBI: 

During the lesson, we played Media Bingo, which included lots about the media (as you could probably tell by the name of the game). The aim of the game was to cross off all of the parts of the game, by asking people questions, and to get vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines to gain more points. In this game I felt like I should have done better and asked people questions, rather than them letting me answer questions for them. Also, I could have contributed more to class discussions. 

What I Found During Homework: 

During our homework task, I found that a lot of companies exaggerate their products to make them have a better track record, and a lot of adverts can be extremely misleading.
